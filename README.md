Hello,
This was a challenge to myself to use async mode to connect data from FTX Exchange.
Let me explain...
First, I would like to check my orders and get some more information and for this I make my first code using regular functions on CCXT library.
Then, after some months, where I had more information to get, I realized that I should use async mode.
I looked for examples, but it was very difficult to find one working properly. 
After a while, I have my code working and then I decided to share with anyone that uses CCXT library.
